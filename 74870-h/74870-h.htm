(formed by inserting a consonant between each syllable of a word, the result being
the F, G, H, M or S gibberish, according to the letter used: thus, “goming mout tom-daym,”

<p class="cit">[The term, says Norton, is derived from the name of Governor Gerry, of Massachusetts,
who, in 1811, signed a Bill readjusting the representative districts so as to favour
the Democrats and weaken the Federalists, although the last-named party polled nearly
two-thirds of the votes cast. A fancied resemblance of a map of the districts thus
treated led Stuart, the painter, to add a few lines with his pencil, and say to Mr.
Russell, editor of the <i>Boston Sentinel</i>. ‘That will do for a Salamander.’ Russell glanced at it: ‘Salamander,’ said he, ‘call
it a <span class="sc">Gerrymander!</span>’ The epithet took at once, and became a Federalist war-cry, the caricature being
published as a campaign document.]

<p class="cit">[The usually accepted derivation that grass = Fr., <i lang="fr">grâce</i> is doubtful. Hall (says J.&nbsp;C. Atkinson, in <i>Glossary of Cleveland Words</i>) gives as the definition of this word ‘an unmarried woman who has had a child’; in
Moor’s <i>Suffolk Words and Phrases</i>, <span class="sc">grace-widow</span>, ‘a woman who has had a child for her cradle ere she has had a husband for her bed’;
and corresponding with this is the N.&nbsp;S. or Low Ger., <i>gras-wedewe</i>. Again, Sw. D., <i>gras-anka</i>, or <i>-enka</i> = <span class="sc">grass-widow</span>, occurs in the same sense as with us: ‘a low, dissolute, unmarried woman living by
herself.’ The original meaning of the word seems to <span class="pageNum" id="pb197">[<a href="#pb197">197</a>]</span>have been ‘a woman whose husband is away,’ either travelling or living apart. The
people of Belgium call a woman of this description <i>haeck-wedewe</i>, from <i>haecken</i>, to feel strong desire.… It seems probable, therefore, from the etymology, taken
in connection with the Clevel. signification, that our word may rather be from the
Scand. source than from the German; only with a translation of the word <i>enka</i> into its English equivalent. Dan. D., <i lang="da">graesenka</i>, is a female whose betrothed lover (fastman) is dead; nearly equivalent to which

pair of dice, and after crying <span class="sc">Hy-jinks</span>, he throws them out; the number he casts out points out the person that must drink;
he who threw beginning at himself number one, and so round till the number of the
person agree with that of the dice (which may fall upon himself if the number be within
twelve); then he sets the dice to him, or bids him take them; he on whom they fall
is obliged to drink, or pay a small forfeiture in money, then throws, and so on. But
if he forgets to cry ‘Hy-jinks’ he pays a forfeiture into the bank. Now, he on whom
it falls to drink (if there be anything in the bank worth drawing) gets it all if
he drinks; then with a great deal of caution he empties his cup, sweeps up the money,
and orders the cup to be filled again, and then throws; for if he errs in the articles
he loses the privilege of drawing the money. The articles are—(1) Drink, (2) Draw,
(3) Fill, (4) Cry ‘Hy-jinks,’ (5) Count just, (6) Chuse your doublet, man—viz., when
two equal numbers of the dice is thrown, the person whom you chuse must pay a double
of the common forfeiture, and so must you when the dice is in his hand (<i>sic</i>).

<p class="main"><b>Hobson’s-choice</b>, <i>subs.</i> (common).—That or none: <i>i.e.</i>, there is no alternative. [Popularly derived from the name of a Cambridge livery
stable keeper, whose rule was that each customer must take the horse next the door,
or have no horse at all. That old Hobson existed is clear from Milton’s epitaph, but
Bellenden Ker (<i>Archæology of Popular Phrases</i>) affirms the story to be a Cambridge hoax, and maintains the proverb to be identical
in sound and sense as the Low Saxon, <i>Op soens schie ho eysche</i> = when he had a kiss he wanted something else.]

[<span class="sc">Hobson’s choice</span>], which by vulgar error is taken and used when a man is reduced to an extremity,
whereas the propriety of the maxim is to use it when you would say there is plenty,
but you must make such a choice as not to hurt another who is to come after you. <i>Ibid<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span></i> He [<span class="sc">Hobson</span>] kept a stable of forty good cattle, always ready and fit for travelling; but when
a man came for a horse he was led into the stable, where there was great choice, but
was obliged to take the horse which stood nearest to the stable-door; so that every
customer was alike well served, according to his chance, and every horse ridden with
the same justice.
